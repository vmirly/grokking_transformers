    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the Spam Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our goal is to build a neural network to classify emails as spam or not spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will implement a simple Perceptron model to demonstrate its limitations on this dataset. Since the Perceptron cannot handle non-linearly separable data, we will then transition to a more powerful neural network model that can effectively classify the emails.\n",
